Programs included here were developed by the group of Theoretical Physics from Universidad de Pamplona - Colombia. 
These routines are useful to compute the decay width of a Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson - photon pair in the SM at LO+NLO, as well as in the MSSM at LO. Results of these routines are reported in arXiv:2507.09395. 

-- How to use

*) Just compile the Mathematica routines. FeynArts, FeynCalc and FeynHelpers are required.

The included codes are: 

0) 0_Script_SM.sh : This bash script is required to evaluate 1_wzgAmp.wls and 2_divfin.wls in the SM.
   0_Script_MSSM.sh : This bash script is required to evaluate 1_wzgAmp.wls and 2_divfin.wls in the MSSM.

i) 1_wzgAmp.wls

This program produces the Feynman amplitudes neccesary in the computation of the Higgs decay width at LO in the SM as well as in the MSSM.

The program generates all the required Feynman Diagrams and its corresponding amplitudes, including divergent and finite part contrubutions in the R_{\zeta} gauge.  

ii) 2_divfin.wls

This code produces separately the sum of the finite and divergent part of all the contributing diagrams to the decay width in the SM or the MSSM using the R_{\zeta} gauge. 

The results of this code can be consulted in the compressed folder results.zip. 

iii) 3_HZAprogram.wls

This code gives the analytical expression of the decay width in the SM by using the unitary gauge.
It also gives an additional text called "ExpressionDWidth" with only the decay width expression.

iv) 4_HZG_SM.m

Here you can find the necessary data to produce the plots of Section 2 for this Higgs decay in the SM. 

v) 5_HZG_MSSM.m 

Sligthly modifications of this code can produce all the plots of Section 3 in the MSSM-RNS. It is required to download the compressed folder outputs.zip. 
If you want the precise code to produce any of the plots of Section 3, please let us know. 

vi) bash manager

This is a bash interface to create a python package with the decay width translated to python language. 
Scienceplot, Matplotlib, numpy and cmath libraries are required.
The plot of branching ratio in SM at LO  is generated and called "brvsmh.pdf"
