Programs included here were developed by the group of Theoretical Physics from Universidad de Pamplona - Colombia. 
These routines are useful to compute the decay width of a Higgs boson decaying into a Z boson - photon pair in the SM at LO,
as well as in the MSSM at LO. 

- How to use

1) Just compile the Mathematica routines. FeynArts, FeynCalc and FeynHelpers are required.

The codes included are: 

i) wolframscript HZAprogram.wls

This gives the analytical expression of the decay width in the SM, and export it to a text called "HZADwidth" which contains the analytical expression and it gives the pdf of the contributing diagrams. 
It also gives an additional text called "ExpressionDWidth" with only the decay width expression.

v) bash manager

This is a bash interface to create a python package with the decay width translated to python language. Scienceplot, Matplotlib, numpy and cmath libraries are required.
The plot of branching ratio in SM at LO  is generated and called "brvsmh.pdf"
